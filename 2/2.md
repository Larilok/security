Weak salt problem
========
## Task
This is normal text ciphered with a strong algorithm (Salsa20), but every line is ciphered with the same key and no nonce is being used. Name the author of these lines.

## Solution

As the text has been encrypted with the same key, we can apply **crib dragging**

## Crib dragging

You take a guess of a common phrase that may appear in one of the plaintexts and exclusive-or that against the XOR of the two original messages in various locations.

We have an 16-time pad.

Line 2-4, 7, 16 and 1, 5, 8, 10-12 and 14-15 starts with a sequence of same letters

We have to guess the author of these lines, so it is likely to be a poem.

In a poem each sentence starts with a capital letter.

Lets try to guess line 1 against line 2 using an online tool https://lzutao.github.io/cribdrag/

After some guessing process I got the line that makes sense.

Google says that the encrypted text is last 16 lines of poem "If" by RUDYARD KIPLING

If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
    And never breathe a word about your loss;  
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,     
And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’  

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,     
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  
    If all men count with you, but none too much;  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute  
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,     
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,     
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
